# Volunteer Matcher
We were using:
* Node.js
* JavaScript
* JSON

## The idea
Volunteer Matcher allows users to discover volunteer opportunities based on their preferences. Additionally, users can subscribe to newsletter and explore all the volunteering options.

## Features
We have built local API from the json files for practicing this part. When users subscribe to the newsletter, we store the data in JSON file on the server. 
Quiz works on tags - each answer has its own tags, most frequently used tag goes to the server and send us all links attached to the tag. 
Every tag has its own "role" so the user see his role in the results, for instance Cat's Nanny ðŸ˜ƒ
If user is not satisfied with results, he can go to search page with simple filter: as you type in input field, items are filtered.
